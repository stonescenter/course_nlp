Data engineers often want to break into machine learning to get more money or because they’re bored!

They should learn
- precision vs recall
These metrics are critical for evaluating the performance of a machine learning model. Precision is how accurate positive predictions are. Recall is how completely the positive predictions are covered.

- the different types of regression
Learn about linear regression and its limitations. Learn about logistic regression as well.

- the other types of models such as XGBoost and Random Forest

Dabbling in these areas will make you better at both #machinelearning and #dataengineering since it’ll inform the upstream data modeling!
