The dual role of carotenoids, both as colorants and potentially as important components of core cellular processes, is the foundation of the resource allocation trade-off hypothesis, which proposes that carotenoid coloration links to individual quality through tradeoffs in use of carotenoids for body maintenance versus ornamentation. This shared pathway hypothesis predicts that, regardless of the carotenoid resources that are available, disruption of core cellular processes, and particularly cellular respiration, will reduce production of carotenoid ornamentation. The process of transforming dietary carotenoids to ketocarotenoids could be a key mechanism responsible for maintaining honesty from converted yellow and red carotenoid-based feather coloration, but this idea has not been rigorously tested.. Alternatively, we categorize carotenoids as ‘converted’ if they are derived from dietary carotenoids that are metabolically oxidized internally by the bird to form ketocarotenoids before deposition to feathers . Previous reviews of condition dependence of carotenoid pigmentation in birds have not considered whether the biochemical processes involved in carotenoid pigmentation—and specifically whether or not dietary carotenoids are metabolically converted—affects the relationship between coloration and quality. We predicted that if the mechanisms of carotenoid metabolism are linked to basic cellular function that comprise individual quality, feather coloration requiring carotenoid metabolism would have a stronger positive relationship with measures of individual quality than feather coloration derived from deposition of unaltered dietary carotenoids. Additionally, metabolism of carotenoids requires the maintenance of enzyme systems and perhaps additional transport of carotenoids that may create stronger links between coloration and system performance for ornaments produced from converted pigments versus unaltered dietary pigments.. We quantitatively synthesized published results on the relationships between individual quality and plumage coloration of passerines produced via dietary versus converted carotenoids. However, including carotenoid type as a predictor reveals that converted, and not dietary, carotenoids are driving the relationship between coloration and quality.
