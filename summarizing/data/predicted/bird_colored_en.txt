The text discusses the relationship between carotenoid-based feather coloration and individual quality in animals, and the mechanisms that maintain the honesty of this signal. The authors performed meta-analyses of published studies on this topic, focusing on the differences between carotenoids that are used as colorants without modification (dietary carotenoids) and those that are metabolically converted before deposition (converted carotenoids). They hypothesized that the relationship between coloration signal and individual quality is stronger in the case of converted carotenoids, as these better reflect the physiological links between carotenoid metabolism and cellular function. The results showed that feather coloration is an honest signal of some measures of quality, but not all. Where these relationships exist, converted carotenoid coloration drives the relationship. These findings have broad implications for understanding the evolutionary role of carotenoid coloration and the physiological mechanisms that maintain signal honesty of animal ornamental traits.
