Despite his talents for saving “Hollywood’s ass”, demolishing two chicken tikka masalas in one sitting and escaping enemy territory in decrepit F-14s, Tom Cruise appears to have conceded that some missions – especially those involving polar bears, helicopters and paperwork – really are impossible.. The local authorities refused permission for the 40-odd helicopter landings on various sites requested by PolarX, the production company involved, citing concerns over disturbance to wildlife.. Cruise, who was pictured on the streets of Longyearbyen on Thursday, declined to discuss the matter with the local paper, Svalbardposten, saying only: “It’s wonderful to be here.” “While a complaint to the Norwegian environment agency was deemed necessary due to the significant time pressure, the production has continuously worked on alternative solutions to meet the governor’s concerns,” the letter said. But the Svalbard authorities decided that given “the purpose of these flights”, permission could not be granted for the helicopter landings, in part because of the precedent it may set “in the context of the goal of limited traffic on Svalbard”.. Ronny Brunvoll, the head of Visit Svalbard, said he questioned whether it was “sensible and necessary to be so categorical in the approach to business activities on the archipelago”.. However, Aleksander Øren Heen, an environment minister, told the broadcaster that the principle of the government’s Svalbard policy was that “in the event of a conflict between environmental protection and other interests, the environment must weigh more heavily”
