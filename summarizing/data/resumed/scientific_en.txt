the authors tested the hypothesis that carotenoid metabolism strengthens the link between feather coloration and individual quality of passerines.

The authors speak about carotenoid coloration is a individuality signal of quality. Author hypothesize that converted carotenoids better reflect individual quality. The feather coloration is honest mark of quality.

Exists carotenoids for feather coloration knowed as 'dietary' if pigment are present in food and deposited in feathers without any metabolic conversation. On the other hand exists carotenoids 'converted' if they are metabolically oxidized internally by bird to form of ketocarotenoids before deposition to feathers.
