The authors speak about carotenoid coloration is a individuality signal of quality. Author hypothesize that converted carotenoids better reflect individual quality. The feather coloration is honest mark of quality.


Researchers hypothesized that the carotenoid coloration is found in many animals fish, reptiles and birds. Carotenoid provides key information about quality and increase fitness.


Carotenoids are considerate relevant molecules used in cellular process knowd as immunocompetence and Vitamin A synthesis as well as antioxidants. Carotenoids can not synthesized by animals, they only ingest yellow carotenoid pigments and other colors like red are bio-converted from yellow to red  


Authors said carotenoids have two roles as colorants and an important componets of core cellular process. This afirmation is the base of resource allocation trade-off hypothesis that propose that carotenoids coloration links to individual quality throught through tradeoffs in use of carotenoids for body maintenance versus ornamentation.
this declaration said, carotenoids are needed both for body mantenance and for ornamentation.


Exists carotenoids for feather coloration knowed as dietary if pigment are present in food and deposited in feathers without any metabolic conversation. In this category we have two pigments lutein and zeaxanthin. On the other hand exists carotenoids converted if they are metabolically oxidized internally by bird to form of ketocarotenoids before deposition to feathers. In this category have echinenone, canthaxanthin and xanthophylls.
